So, those files in repo are copy-pasted from my colab noteboks. There is some work to do, cuz right now they're lack of data.
1. Change files/input
2. Modyfi file/input
3. It should work 
For example, most programs depends on files inside my google drive, so won't work raw.
There's plenty more algorithms implemented, but no commited yet to this repo.
My plan is to put them all here and add some omega-delta-gamma-ultra-alpha data generator for them to work.
